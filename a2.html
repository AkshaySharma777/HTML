          <big><b>Ancient India</b></big> <br>

          <br>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or <b><i>Homo sapiens</i></b>, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent <br> from Africa, where they had earlier evolved. <b><sup>[31][32][33]</sup></b> The earliest known modern human remains in South <br>Asia date to about 30,000 years ago. <b><sup>[31]</sup></b> After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and <br>animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in <b>Mehrgarh</b> and <br>other sites in <b>Balochistan, Pakistan. <sup>[86]</sup></b>These gradually developed into the <b>Indus Valley Civilisation,<sup>[87][86]</sup></b>the <br>first urban culture in South Asia,<b><sup>[88]</sup></b> which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western <br>India. <b><sup>[89]</sup></b> Centred on cities such as <b>Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira,</b> and <b>Kalibangan,</b> and relying on varied <br>forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade. <b><sup>[88]</sup></b> <br>
         
           <br> During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the <b>Chalcolithic</b> <br>cultures to the <b>Iron Age</b> ones. <b><sup>[90]</sup></b> The <b>Vedas,</b> the oldest scriptures associated with <b>Hinduism,<sup>[91]</sup></b> were <br>composed during this period,<b><sup>[92]</sup></b> and historians have analysed these to posit a <b>Vedic culture</b> in the <b>Punjab</b> <br>region and the upper <b>Gangetic Plain.<sup>[90]</sup></b> Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed <br>several waves of <b>Indo-Aryan migration</b> into the subcontinent from the north-west. <b><sup>[91]</sup></b> The <b>caste system,</b> which <br>created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by <br>labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period. <b><sup>[93]</sup></b> On the <b>Deccan Plateau,</b> archaeological <br>evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation. <b><sup>[90]</sup></b> In South <br>India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of <b>megalithic</b> monuments dating from <br>this period,<b><sup>[94]</sup></b> as well as by nearby traces of <b>agriculture, irrigation tanks,</b> and craft traditions. <b><sup>[94]</sup></b> <br>
           
           <br>In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain <br>and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known <br>as the <b>mahajanapadas.<sup>[95][96]</sup></b> The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of <br>which became independent religions. <b>Jainism</b> came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, <br><b>Mahavira.<sup>[97]</sup> Buddhism,</b> based on the teachings of <b>Gautama Buddha,</b> attracted followers from all social <br>classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded <br>history in India. <b><sup>[98][99][100]</sup></b> In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up <b>renunciation</b> as an ideal,<b><sup>[101]</sup></b> <br>and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of <b>Magadha</b>  <br>had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the <b>Mauryan Empire. <sup>[102]</sup></b> The empire was once thought to <br>have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been <br>separated by large autonomous areas. <b><sup>[103][104]</sup></b> The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building <br>and determined management of public life as for <b>Ashoka's</b> renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the <br><b>Buddhist dhamma.<sup>[105][106]</sup></b> <br>
           
           <br>The <b>Sangam</b> literature of the <b>Tamil language</b> reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula <br>was ruled by the <b>Cheras,</b> the <b>Cholas,</b> and the <b>Pandyas,</b> dynasties that <b>traded extensively with the Roman Empire</b> <br>and with <b>West</b> and <b>Southeast Asia.<sup>[107][108]</sup></b> In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, <br>leading to increased subordination of women. <b><sup>[109][102]</sup></b> By the 4th and 5th centuries, the <b>Gupta Empire</b> had created <br>a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later <br>Indian kingdoms. <b><sup>[110][111]</sup></b> Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management <br>of ritual, began to assert itself. <b><sup>[112]</sup></b>This renewal was reflected in a flowering of <b>sculpture</b> and <b>architecture,</b> which <br>found patrons among an urban elite. <b><sup>[111]</sup> Classical Sanskrit literature</b>  flowered as well, and <b>Indian science, <br>astronomy, medicine,</b> and mathematics made significant advances. <b><sup>[111]</sup></b>
